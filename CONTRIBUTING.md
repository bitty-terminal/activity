# Contributing to activity

This guide is for contributors to the `activity` plugin repository. The
repository is pre-implementation: everything here is governance scaffolding,
a minimal scaffold, and a candidate plugin layout, not shipped behavior.

## Repository ground rules

- Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) before making any change. It defines authority,
  scope boundaries, CarryCtx workflow, toolchain policy, and the security and
  privacy constraints that override convenience.
- Canonical plugin architecture, API, packaging, compatibility, and security
  contracts live in `bitty-docs` and `bitty-plugins-docs`. This repository
  must not invent capabilities, lifecycle semantics, or release policy
  independently.
- Never commit, push, publish packages, or mutate remote state without
  explicit authorization from the owning task.

## Prerequisites

Toolchain expectations (dependency versions are pinned in
[package.json](package.json) and locked in `bun.lock`; never invoke formatters
or linters by name):

- `just` — command runner owning all quality-gate invocations.
- `bun` / `bun run <bin>` — JavaScript execution and package management; the
  justfile invokes installed tools as `bun run <bin>`. Never use `npm`, `npx`,
  or `yarn` in any Bitty repository.
- `markdownlint-cli2`, `prettier`, `commitlint`, `lefthook` — materialized by
  `just install` and invoked through the justfile.

## Development setup

1. Enter this repository before running Git, CarryCtx, or toolchain commands.
2. Install pinned development dependencies: `just install`.
3. Enable Git hooks (optional): `just hooks-install`.
4. Run all quality gates: `just check` (Markdown lint, Prettier format check,
   manifest validation, and Lua parse). CI runs the same aggregate target.
5. Record scoped work in CarryCtx (task, session, progress, checkpoint) and
   stop at review; independent review is required for acceptance.

## Delivery lifecycle

Changes follow Issue -> Branch -> Commit -> Pull Request -> Review -> Merge,
where independent review plus required CI must pass before merge. Before this
repository's first commit, branch/worktree/commit/pull-request stages are
unavailable: initialization happens in a shared checkout with explicit
disjoint scopes, preserved unrelated changes, and CI-equivalent local checks.

Every pull request states its Issue and CarryCtx task links, impact areas,
security and privacy impact, reproducible gate evidence, and documentation
synchronization status. Labels (`feat`/`fix`/`docs`/`chore`, `P0`/`P1`/`P2`,
`area:*`) and milestone `v0.1.0` are kept in sync.

## Contributor branches

The project is managed with CarryCtx. Official branches follow the CarryCtx
task convention `ctx-XXXX/<type>-<slug>`, where `XXXX` is the owning task id,
`<type>` is one of `feat|fix|chore|docs`, and the slug is short kebab-case.
Commander housekeeping branches use `cmd/<slug>`.

External contributors must use a distinguishable prefix such as
`<github-handle>/<type>-<slug>` (for example `octocat/fix-manifest-lint`) so
their branches are never confused with maintainer task branches.

## Capabilities and privacy

Manifest capability requests are deny by default and must stay minimal. The
scaffold requests only `terminal.semantic-read` and `platform.notify`; any
wider request requires an explicitly scoped task plus a reviewed privacy and
security note. Never add high-risk capabilities, install scripts, secrets, or
ambient authority as a side effect of an unrelated change.

## Workflow snapshots

The engineering workflow snapshot lives in this repository on the branch
`refs/heads/carryctx-snapshots`. Merges run `just workflow-publish` (dry run:
`just workflow-publish-dry`) as part of the commander closeout; snapshots are
redacted publication artifacts and are never merged back. Fresh clones restore
with `just workflow-import` (`just workflow-import-dry`).

## Reporting

Report bugs and feature requests through the GitHub issue templates. Report
security issues privately per [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
